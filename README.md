### Hi there 👋, I am Dmitriy Nazarenko

#### I work as a Full-Stack developer

I am 27 years old, graduated from the Kyiv University of Communications, but I began to study programming on my own. It
grew from a hobby to a job. Doing what you like is cool!
Interested in front and back development, system architecture, databases, cloud computing and neural networks.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning microservice architecture
- ⚡ Fun fact: The first programming language: php 🐘
